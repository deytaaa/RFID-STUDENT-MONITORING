<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview

This is a React JavaScript dashboard for an RFID-enabled IoT-based gate and monitoring system. The frontend communicates with a backend API to manage access control, monitor gate status, and provide real-time updates.

## Key Features

- Real-time gate status monitoring
- RFID access log display
- User access management
- System health monitoring
- Interactive charts and analytics
- Mobile-responsive design

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use semantic HTML and accessible components
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Implement proper prop validation where needed

## Architecture

- Components should be modular and reusable
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Implement proper data fetching patterns
- Use context for global state management when needed
- Follow separation of concerns principle

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Vite for build tooling
- CSS Modules or styled-components for styling
- Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization
- Socket.io-client for real-time updates
- Axios for API communication
